# [Bootstrap for WordPress](https://github.com/enile8/Bootstrap-for-WordPress)

This is my port of Twitters Bootstrap theme (updated to 2.0) to WordPress, I use the term of port loosely. It still needs quite a bit of work, I start the project a while ago and wrote a blog post about it, I noticed that soon after that post started getting a lot of attention and interest so I thought that I would package up what I had and set it free.

##Quick start

* Clone the git repo `git clone git://github.com/enile8/Bootstrap-for-WordPress.git` - or [download it](https://github.com/enile8/Bootstrap-for-WordPress/zipball/master)
* Just upload it and activate it like any other WordPress theme

## Contributing

Anyone and everyone is welcome to contribute. As I noted earlier there are still many issues with this theme, but unfortunately I just don't have the time right not to do anymore with it. If you would like to contribute some code or fixes back to this package feel free too.

### Major components:

* [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/): Apache 2.0 license
